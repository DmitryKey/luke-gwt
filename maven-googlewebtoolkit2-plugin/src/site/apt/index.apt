GWT-Maven (maven-googlewebtoolkit2-plugin)


 GWT-Maven is a plugin to provide support for Google Web Toolkit projects, including
 running the GWT developer tools (the compiler and shell) and performing support operations to help
 developers make GWT fit more closely in with their standard JEE web application
 development (debugging, managing the emebedded server, running noserver, merging web.xml, generating I18N interfaces, generating client beans, and more).
 
 NOTE: This plugin is being maintained, but new features are NOT being added here. We are trying to stabilize and then freeze development
 on this plugin so we (the GWT-Maven developers) can focus on helping support the Codehaus GWT Maven plugin (http://mojo.codehaus.org/gwt-maven-plugin/).
 The Codehaus GWT Maven plugin is NOT YET sanctioned or approved or recommended by us, because we aren't yet familiar with it. 
 We have however agreed to join that project and make sure it has all the same goals and features (and docs, etc) as this one. 
 We have yet to begin that work though, because we can't get started there until this plugin is stable and frozen (too much to juggle to work on both simultaneously). 
 AS SOON AS THE MERGE *AND SIGN OFF* AT CODEHAUS HAS HAPPENED, THIS DOCUMENTATION WILL BE UPDATED TO REFLECT THAT.
